🚀 File Organizer

"File Organizer" is a Python-based file system automation utility engineered to intelligently classify, structure, and reorganize unstructured directories using extension-based categorization.
The system leverages Python’s OS-level abstractions to perform deterministic file analysis, dynamic directory provisioning, and safe relocation of assets — improving digital workspace maintainability and operational efficiency.
This project demonstrates practical automation engineering, clean architecture principles, and structured repository management using Git.

 🧠 Problem Context
Unstructured directories (e.g., *Downloads*, *Desktop*) frequently accumulate heterogeneous file types, leading to:
• Increased retrieval latency
• Reduced productivity
• Poor directory hygiene
• Manual file maintenance overhead

This tool programmatically enforces a deterministic folder hierarchy to eliminate clutter and optimize file discoverability.

🧩 Engineering Decisions

🔹 Deterministic Mapping Strategy
    A dictionary-based extension mapping ensures **O(1)** lookup time for file categorization.
    
 🔹 Dynamic Directory Provisioning
    `os.makedirs()` safely creates folders without raising redundant exceptions.

 🔹 Atomic File Movement
    `shutil.move()` provides reliable file relocation with underlying OS-level handling.

🔹 Scalability Considerations
  The architecture allows easy:
• Addition of new categories
• Integration of CLI arguments
• Logging integration
• GUI extension



📈 Performance Characteristics

• **Time Complexity:** O(n), where *n* = number of files
• **Space Complexity:** O(1) auxiliary space
• Efficient for small to medium-sized directories

🧠 Key Technical Competencies Demonstrated
• File system automation
• OS abstraction handling
• Structured procedural design
• Clean repository management
• Git branching and commit hygiene
• Real-world problem modeling
